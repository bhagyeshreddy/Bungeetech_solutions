The following is the solutions for Bungee Coding Round.
I have used Python as my languague and some computaional libraries from it.
Since the output required is mainly concerned with numerical computaions and dataframes I have imported numpy and pandas as my go to libraries.
Data has been imported and read in as a csv file.
To check the data of first six rows head() function has been used.

For first question:
  * The given problem statement was to group the year by decades and later calculate its sum
  * A simple group by function with the formula will do the job

For second question:
  * To find the max and min ages of each occupation, again groupby function is used along with the aggregrate funtion.
  * It had returned the required min and max ages

For third question:
  * After reading the file, only the red cards and yellow cards were selected
  * Sorting has been done for red cards first and then yellow cards.
